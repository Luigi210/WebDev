<h3 id = "lyrics">"I Hate Everything About You"<br>
    <br>
    Okay, she keep cryin', she keep cryin' every single night<br>
Day and night, on my mind, please don't kill the vibe<br>
Oh no, I swear to God, I be in my mind<br>
Swear I wanna die, yeah, when you cross myâ€”<br>
Said I wanna die, yuh, no, I'm not alright, yuh<br>
I might start a riot, yuh, I'm so fuckin' tired, yuh<br>
So what's up? What you say? Feelin' good, I'm feelin' great<br>
Tired of the fuckin' hate, stackin' cheese all on my plate<br>
    <br>
    So outside my misery, I think I'll find<br>
A way of envisioning a better life<br>
For the rest of us, the rest of us<br>
There's hope for the rest of us, the rest of us<br>
    <br>
    Only when I stop to think about it<br>
    <br>
    I hate everything about you<br>
    Why do I love you?<br>
    I hate everything about you<br>
    Why do I love you?<br>
    <br>
    Every time we lie awake<br>
    After every hit we take<br>
    Every feeling that I get<br>
    But I haven't missed you yet<br>
    <br>
    Only when I stop to think about it<br>
    <br>
    I hate everything about you<br>
    Why do I love you?<br>
    I hate everything about you<br>
    Why do I love you?<br>
    <br>
    Only when I stop to think about you<br>
    I know<br>
    Only when you stop to think about me<br>
    Do you know?<br>
    <br>
    I hate everything about you<br>
    Why do I love you?<br>
    You hate everything about me<br>
    Why do you love me?<br>
    <br>
    I hate<br>
    You hate<br>
    I hate<br>
    You love me<br>
    <br>
    I hate everything about you<br>
    Why do I love you?<br>
